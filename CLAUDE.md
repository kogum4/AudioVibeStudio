private getMimeType(format: string): string {
  switch (format) {
    case 'mp4':
      // Prioritize widely supported H.264 profiles
      if (MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported('video/mp4;codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2')) {
        return 'video/mp4;codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'; // H.264 Baseline + AAC LC
      } else if (MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported('video/mp4;codecs=avc1.42001E,mp4a.40.2')) {
        return 'video/mp4;codecs=avc1.42001E,mp4a.40.2'; // H.264 Constrained Baseline + AAC LC
      }
      // ... additional fallbacks
